This tool will automate the full translation from an E/R diagram, specifically those created using the freely available online tool ERDPlus, into executable SQL code.

To use:

1. Add .erdplus file into er_translation/examples
2. Change the path to the file in main function in main.py
3. Execute main.py

Future: this will be a runnable standalone package
